# Rule 106 was added long after this role has been created.
# The ansible-lint removes the prefix "ansible-role-*" for this test, and not the "ansible-" prefix.
# Any role in the form of "ansible-*" is broken with this in.
# Instead of renaming my role and breaking the world, I will just ignore that lint test.
