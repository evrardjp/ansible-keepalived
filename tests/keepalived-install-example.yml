# This is a standalone playbook to install keepalived
# on all nodes, having the first node the master, and
# the rest of nodes as fallback.
# In your own environment, you should probably
# have your own group/host vars to define the content
# of the necessary keepalived variables.

- name: Install keepalived
  hosts: keepalived
  order: sorted
  vars:
    # keepalived_instances is something you MUST DEFINE for your own env.
    #
    # A few notes:
    # - All nodes will broadcast vrrp on the interface of
    #   the keepalived_instance.
    #   Instead of using a single var for ALL the nodes,
    #   it might make sense to set interface to a certain variable,
    #   and use group/host vars to override it where it makes sense.
    # - Use a single virtual_router_id per multicast/broadcast domain.
    #   Regardless of the password you use.
    # - Make sure the priority has at least 50 if not 100 between master and backups.
    #   Read VRRP protocol for why :)
    #   If you are lazy,
