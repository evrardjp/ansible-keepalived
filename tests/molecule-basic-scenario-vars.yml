# This is a standalone playbook to install keepalived
# on all nodes, having the first node the master, and
# the rest of nodes as fallback.
# In your own environment, you should probably
# have your own group/host vars to define the content
# of the necessary keepalived variables.

keepalived_instances:
  internal:
    interface: "{{ vrrp_nic | default(ansible_default_ipv4.interface, true) }}"
    # You can also use your own variable to determine which node is master and who
    state: "{{ (groups['keepalived'].index(inventory_hostname) == 0) | ternary('MASTER','BACKUP') }}"
    virtual_router_id: "{{ vrrp_id | default(42) }}"
    # I advise you to define your own priority per node, instead of a generic all or nothing.
    # Especially if you have more than two nodes.
    priority: "{{ (inventory_hostname == groups['keepalived'][0]) | ternary('200', '100') }}"
    # Do not forget to define the VIPs, and their CIDR.

      - "{{ vrrp_ip | default('192.168.56.2/24') }} dev {{ vrrp_nic | default(ansible_default_ipv4.interface, true) }}"
